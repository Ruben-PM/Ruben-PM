- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ruben-PM
- 👀 I’m interested in Database, but I started off (1 month ago) by learning Front-End first
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS. Really new to this field, please bare with me ^^
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the project that I can implement vanilla JS. I want to be (at least) good at it, before learning framework
- 📫 How to reach me @Ruben-PM (GitHub), @Ruben1908 (Telegram)
